Support Vector Machines work by attempting to fit a hyper-place between categories when entries mapped in n-dimensiomnal space.
If first applies a hyper-plane that maps categories to the correct class (as best possible), then alters it's space
between categories to maximise margin.
The points closest on either side of the margin, are our support vectors
