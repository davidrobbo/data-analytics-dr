Identity matrix = I = [1, 0], [0, 1] = does nothing

Types of transformation matrics
Rotations and Reflections, Enlargements, Shear, Translation, Singular, Inverse, Determinant

Matrix mulplication
| a b | * | e f |
| c d |   | g h |

=
| (ae + bg) (af + bh) |
| (ce + dg) (cf + dh) |

Gaussian elimination and link to simulatenous equations

1a 2b 3c = 10
2a 2b 1c = 10
4a 2b 1c = 20

Can be represented as

1 2 3 a = 10
2 2 1 b = 10
4 2 1 c - 20

Solving the above in essence leads us back to identity matric
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
A matrix multiplied by it's inverse = Identity matrix

Elimination and back-substitution can be done simultaneously against the identity matrix to find our inverse

I = 1 0 0
    0 1 0
    0 0 1
